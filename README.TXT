MineSweeper
-----------

Version 0.0.1

Version 0.0.2
-------------

Added top 10 scores per game.

Version 0.0.3
-------------

Fixed Bug in scores sort routines.

Version 0.0.4 to 0.8.666
------------------------

Hey, this is my app, I can skip version numbers if I want to.

Version 0.9.0
-------------

Let's call this the pre release version.
Did some cleanup of the code and fixed a few minor irretations.

Version 0.9.1
-------------

1. Fixed the bug where if you flagged a cell you are able to click it and expose an empty tile which is then rendered useless even if it is a bomb.
2. Made the Smily Face go down and up when F2 is pressed for a new game.
3. Added a few mousepointers to show activity.

Version 0.9.2
-------------

Added a Custom Game.

Version 0.9.3
-------------

Changed the controls to not get the focus, so that the menu hot-keys can work.

Version 0.9.4
-------------

Added Hint Menu item and Hotkey (Ctrl+H)

Version 0.9.5
-------------

Changed the algorithm to calculate the mines positions slightly, hope this speeds it up.

Version 0.9.6
-------------

Added the shift-mouse click functionality found in the microsoft version whereby you can clear the tiles if you have flagged the correct number of mines for the tile you are on!

Version 0.9.7
-------------

Added the simultanaeous click of both the L and R mouse buttons functionality found in the microsoft version whereby you can clear the tiles if you have flagged the correct number of mines for the tile you are on!
This is the same as the shift-mouse click functionality i added in 0.9.6
(Thanks to Paulash Mohsen, for pointing this out to me.)

The Game
--------
Has the look and feel of the minesweeper game that comes with windows.
Hope I'm not breaking any copyright laws here, if I am, please let me know.

Future enhancements
-------------------
1. I know there is a little bug with the top scores, but i'll get to that later as it doesn't distract from the game play!

Any suggestions, bugs etc. please let me know
